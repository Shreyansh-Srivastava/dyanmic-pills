                <h4>About:</h4>
                <p>It is an individual activity which student has to perform every semester where student gets an oppourtunity to showcase his/her skills and develop an industry ready innovative product (project). The project should be on a software based domains as per student interests and each student is assigned with a faculty as a guide who looks after their progress every week. It is a credit course which is included in the syllabus of student every semester.</p>
    
                <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Real-world experience: Software development projects can simulate the experience of working on a software development team in a professional setting. This can help students develop their skills in software development, project management, and teamwork, giving them an opportunity to apply the concepts they have learned in class.</li>
                    <li>Agile project management: Agile project management is widely used in software development, and learning to apply agile methodologies can prepare students for the fast-paced and iterative development processes used in the industry. Working on a software development project can help students develop skills in agile project management, including planning, backlog management, and sprint execution.</li>
                    <li>Specialization: Software development projects allow students to specialize in areas that interest them, such as front-end development, back-end development, or database development. This division of labor can lead to a more efficient use of time and resources, as well as better overall results.</li>
                    <li>Hands-on experience with development tools: Software development projects can give students hands-on experience with the tools and technologies used in the industry, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), version control systems, and testing frameworks.</li>
                    <li>Professional development: Working on software development projects can help students develop their professional skills, such as time management, problem-solving, and communication. These skills can help them succeed in their future careers in software development.</li>
